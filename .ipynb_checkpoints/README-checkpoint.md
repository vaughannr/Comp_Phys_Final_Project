# Comp_Phys_Final_Project
Exploring the chaotic Behavior of a double pendulum. Based my ODE functionality on 
https://scipython.com/blog/the-double-pendulum/ Though I wrote the code myself to fit my parameters.
Highly recommend that blog for python physics projects.

No PDF for this project. The LaTex had issues converting. Either way, it's probably better in notebook anyway.
